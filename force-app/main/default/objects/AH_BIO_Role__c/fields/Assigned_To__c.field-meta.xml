    <description>This field could be a Lookup to User.  However, if this Salesforce Assessment Tool is adopted by a group outside of Hospitality, then we would need to provide licenses for all people in that group that need to be assigned to security roles, rather than a single &quot;Security Assessment Administrator&quot;.  The real pain being when role assignments change and licenses need to be transferred.  Since the &quot;Role&quot; field is really the key field in this object, and the &quot;Assigned To&quot; really just a helpful reference point, I&apos;d rather avoid the potential maintenance effort and just use a text field.</description>
